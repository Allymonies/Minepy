# Minepy
Log into Minecraft servers through Python
---
This is mostly just a personal project to see if I could, there are multiple way better implemenations of code that allows you to join and communicate with Minecraft servers, Some even in python.
If anyone finds this repository and decides they want to try it, well installation is up to you though I'll do my best to list dependencies.
